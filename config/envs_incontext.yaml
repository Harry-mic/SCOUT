  CoordSokoban:
    env_type: sokoban
    max_actions_per_traj: 10
    env_instruction: |
      You are solving the Sokoban puzzle. You are the player and you need to push all boxes to targets.
      You are provided with a symbol grid and the zero-indexed coordinates of the player, each box, and each target. 
      Coordinates range from the top-left corner (0, 0) to the bottom-right corner (5, 5). 
      When you are exactly next to a box, you can push it by moving in the same direction. 
      You cannot push a box through a wall, and you cannot pull a box.
      The answer should be a sequence of actions, like <answer>Right || Right || Up</answer>.

      To faciliate your understanding, I will provide a successful trajectory for you. You can analyze and learn the dynamic from it:

    env_instruction: |
      You are solving the FrozenLake puzzle. The observation includes both a symbol grid and zero-indexed coordinates for the start, goal, player, and any holes.
      Coordinates range from the top-left corner (0, 0) to the bottom-right corner (5, 5).
      Beware that the ice is slippery, so the agent might slide and end up in an unintended tile.
      Respond with a sequence of actions such as <answer>Left || Up || Up</answer>.

      You are playing the 2048 game on a 4x4 grid. Merge equal tiles by sliding Up, Right, Down, or Left.
      If a move is invalid (no tiles move), a small penalty is applied. Respond with a single action.

    env_instruction: |
      You are solving a 2x2 Rubik's Cube (Pocket Cube). The goal is to restore the cube so that each of the faces consists of a single, unique color.
      Available actions use standard Singmaster notation for face rotations: U, U', D, D', L, L', R, R', F, F', B, B'.
      - Faces: U (Up), D (Down), L (Left), R (Right), F (Front), B (Back).
      - Modifiers: A letter alone means 90° clockwise (e.g., 'R'). A letter with prime (') means 90° counter-clockwise (e.g., "R'").
      Respond with a sequence of actions separated by "||".
      Example: <answer>U</answer>

    env_instruction: |
      You are solving a Sudoku puzzle. Fill in the grid so that every row, column, and 2x2 box contains the numbers 1-4 without repetition.
      Initial cells are shown in [brackets] and cannot be modified. Empty cells are shown as dots (.).
      Place numbers one at a time using the format, for example: <answer>place 1 at row 2 col 3</answer> or <answer>1,2,3</answer>
      The environment will provide feedback on valid/invalid moves and show conflicts if any occur.
